# egghead-idiomatic
my attempt to mix the Create Your First React App with the Idiomatic Redux code base...

NOTE: this code no longer uses firebase and re-base

We are now using `json-server` to handle reading & writing notes:

```javascript
npm install -g json-server
json-server db.json
```

View the content of `db.json` in order to see the changes you are making to notes.
